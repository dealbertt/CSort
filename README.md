# CSort
A sorting algorithm visualizer, inspired by the great Sound Of Sorting from Timo Bingmann  
This project uses SDL3 with C++ 
- For now you can use Arrow Up and Down to increase or decrease the speed of the sorting  
- You can also use CTRL + Arrow Up/ Arrow Donw to increase or decrease the volume  
- When an algorithm is being executed, you can pressed Space to skip to the next one (experimental feature)
