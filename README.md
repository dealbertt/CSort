# CSort
A sorting algorithm visualizer, inspired by the great Sound Of Sorting from Timo Bingmann  
This project uses SDL2 (soon to be SDL3) with C++ 
- For now you can use Arrow Up and Down to increase or decrease the speed of the sorting  

(not abandoned, coming back soon)

I HAVE TO PORT IT BACK TO SDL3, AS I DIDNT USE SDL_MIXER (ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH SDL2)
